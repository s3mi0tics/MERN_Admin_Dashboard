A dedicated page for managing products, showcasing:

- Product list with ratings, descriptions, categories, and "see more" functionality.

### Customers Page

### Transaction Page

Efficient server-side pagination for handling large sets of transaction data.

### Geography Page

An insightful view of user locations through a geographical representation.

### Charts

Various charts to provide a comprehensive overview:

- A line chart illustrating monthly revenue, switchable between sales and units.
- Daily and monthly charts with customizable date ranges for sales analysis.
